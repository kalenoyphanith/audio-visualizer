## Audio Visualizer
The main purpose was to create a visualizer that reacts to audio. I want a light visualizer that would look appealing using light colors and simple shapes.

- The user is able to use controls to change the volume, size of some shapes, and also control the bass. They are also enabled to choose whatever shapes they desire to appear on the screen. In addition, they are able to pick filters to their liking.
- Written in JavaScript, HTML Canvas, and HTML/CSS
